What's New :
- Added a buttons.txt where you can paramter buttons for tires and fuel (use joystick_test.exe program to know joy number and button number of your joystick)




1er post :



Here is my first app. It's a real time timing table.

[u][i][b]Features :[/b][/i][/u]

- Position in real-time.
- Gaps in real-time with color code.
- Delta graph that show the relative gap evolution in the current lap and the track position for each car.
- Estimated apex speed and top speedfor all cars, in kph or mph depending on iRacing settings.
- Pit lane and pit stop times.
- Off-track counter.
- Pit counter.
- Driver name or Team name is displayed.
- Sort by, position, number, name, irating, last laptime, best laptime, laps complete in the stint, pitlane time, pit stop time and incidents --> click on the title
- Animations when positions change or last and best laptime change.
- It also works with replay
- It works on external devices using a classic browser
- Broadcast timing to share your timing with your friends.
- You can doubleclick on a driver to change relative gap calculation
- You can customize the datas you want to display by editing the file "template.txt" or simply clicking in the infos zone
- Flags status
- Fuel needed calculations and set the amount of fuel by one click.
- and more to come ...

[u][i][b]Known issues :[/b][/i][/u]

- IE incompatibility

[u][i][b]Installation Notes :[/b][/i][/u]

1) Run the setup file and follow the steps (don't install in program files because you won't be able to edit config files)


To run it locally on your iRacing computer :

1) Run "JRT Server"
2) Open Timing.html (I tested on Chrome and Firefox. Chrome is much smoother with less CPU use)
3) Start iRacing
4) Enjoy !


To run it on an external device with WIFI :

1) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
2) Run "JRT Server"
3) Open a browser on your device like chrome or firefox
4) Enter the adress : http://localip:PORT/timing.html where localip is the local ip or your iRacing computer and PORT is the port you entered in 1)
5) Create a shortcut on your mobil desktop to run it in fullscreen

To run it on an external device with USB tethering mode:

1) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
2) Edit the tethering_mode.txt file : set 1 on the first line and the IPv4 adress of your phone connection on the second line
3) Run "JRT Server"
4) Open a browser on your device like chrome or firefox
5) Enter the adress : http://localip:PORT/timing.html where localip is the ip you entered in 2) and PORT is the port you entered in 1)
6) Create a shortcut on your mobil desktop to run it in fullscreen


To share your timing on the internet :

1) Run "JRT Server"
2) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
3) Configure your router to open the TCP ports 8000 (or the one you choose above) and 8003. It depends on your router but on mine I have to add a firewall for each port and the activate them telling your router to redirect it to your local IP.
4) On the internet, people enter the adress : http://webip:PORT/timing.html where webip is your ip on the web and PORT is the port you entered in 2)

NOTES : 
- I use the ports 8001 to communicate with the server for the local version
- I use the port 8003 to transfert the datas through the internet for the broadcast version


OPTIONS :

Here are the Config files that you can edit:
- fps.txt : the refresh rate of the web page
- fps_broadcast.txt : the refresh rate of the web page for the broadcast
- fps_calc.txt : the refresh rate for the speed calculations.
- template.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order for the timing.html page
  you can also choose to hide the paypal and/or the infos bars by setting the disp_paypal value and/or the disp_infosbar value to 0.
- template2.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order ... for the timing2.html page
- template3.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order ... for the timing3.html page
- webserver port.txt : the port you want to use for the webserver
- pitstrategy.txt : edit this for more accurate calculations on Laps remaining


- By default, the refresh rate is 1 frames per second. You may increase it but for some tablets, it's too fast and it can induce some lags.
- Click on the session infos at the top and you will be able to select the columns you want to display. Then, just click on a title.
  You can also change the modes for NAME, iR and Lic by clicking on the title. But be careful that for the moment, the changes you do are not saved.
- Click on the fuel needed number to set the amount of fuel to add in iRacing
- Click on Tank info to swap between 'last lap' and 'last 5 laps' for the fuel calculations
- The number of incident is an estimation only of the off-tracks and could be wrong depending on the connections of the drivers.

Quoi de neuf :
- Fixed some bugs that made the application crashes
- Replace the pitstrategy.txt file by a folder that contains one file by track and car combination and one common file. It is automatically created when you join a session.
