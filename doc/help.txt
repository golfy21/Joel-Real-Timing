Installation Notes :

1) Run the setup file and follow the steps (don't install in program files or you will need to run the program as administrator)
2) Run "JRT Server" and then look at "My Documents" folder, you should have a new folder created named "Joel Real Timing" where you have config files you can edit.


To run it locally on your iRacing computer :

1) Run "JRT Server"
2) Open Timing.html (I tested on Chrome and Firefox. Chrome is much smoother with less CPU use)
3) Start iRacing
4) Enjoy !


To run it on an external device with WIFI :

1) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
2) Run "JRT Server"
3) Open a browser on your device like chrome or firefox
4) Enter the adress : http://localip:PORT/timing.html where localip is the local ip or your iRacing computer and PORT is the port you entered in 1)
5) Create a shortcut on your mobil desktop to run it in fullscreen

To run it on an external device with USB tethering mode:

1) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
2) Edit the tethering_mode.txt file : set 1 on the first line and the IPv4 adress of your phone connection on the second line
3) Run "JRT Server"
4) Open a browser on your device like chrome or firefox
5) Enter the adress : http://localip:PORT/timing.html where localip is the ip you entered in 2) and PORT is the port you entered in 1)
6) Create a shortcut on your mobil desktop to run it in fullscreen


To share your timing on the internet :

1) Run "JRT Server"
2) Edit the "webserver port.txt" file with the port you want to use for your http server (usually 80 but that doesn't work on my computer)
3) Configure your router to open the TCP ports 8000 (or the one you choose above) and 8003. It depends on your router but on mine I have to add a firewall rule for each port and the activate them telling your router to redirect it to your local IP.
4) On the internet, people enter the adress : http://webip:PORT/timing.html where webip is your ip on the web and PORT is the port you entered in 2)

NOTES : 
- I use the ports 8001 to communicate with the server for the local version
- I use the port 8003 to transfert the datas through the internet for the broadcast version


OPTIONS :

Each time you edit a config file you have to stop and restart "JRT server"
Here are the Config files that you can edit in the "My Documents/Joel Real Timing" folder:
- fps.txt : the refresh rate of the web page
- fps_broadcast.txt : the refresh rate of the web page for the broadcast
- fps_calc.txt : the refresh rate for the speed calculations.
- template.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order for the timing.html page
  you can also choose to hide the paypal and/or the infos bars by setting the disp_paypal value and/or the disp_infosbar value to 0.
- template2.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order ... for the timing2.html page
- template3.txt : you can change the columns width and the columns order ... for the timing3.html page
- webserver port.txt : the port you want to use for the webserver
- pitstrategy folder : edit the files corresponding to the car and the track for more accurate calculations on Laps remaining.
- buttons.txt : this allow you to set a button for fuel, tires and switching to F3 box style (use joystick_test.exe to know the values to set)
- By default, the refresh rate is 1 frames per second. You may increase it but for some tablets, it's too fast and it can induce some lags.
- Click on the session infos at the top and you will be able to select the columns you want to display. Then, just click on a title.
  You can also change the modes for NAME, iR and Lic by clicking on the title. But be careful that for the moment, the changes you do are not saved.
- Click on the fuel needed number to set the amount of fuel to add in iRacing
- Click on Tank info to swap between 'last lap' and 'last 5 laps' for the fuel calculations
- You can display only the class you want by clicking on the SOF corresponding.
- The number of incident is an estimation only of the off-tracks and could be wrong depending on the connections of the drivers.
- Click anywhere in the timing at the right and it will display an options box.
- Click anywhere in the timing at the left and it will display the trackmap (note that the trackmap is auto-generated and it doesn't work if you don't drive the car) .
- When you use the relatives F3 box mode, the driver selected is automatically the driver focused in iRacing and you can't change it directly on the web page.



IMORTANT !
- Set the maximum car in iRacing to 63 if you want to see all the cars in the timing




Cheers,
Joel G.
